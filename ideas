Project ideas:  
X Simuate brownian motion of a larger particle amongst a bunch of small ones  
- create a fourier transform program, apply it to sounds first. 
- create an MRI image out of the raw data from this page (https://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/chap-10/detail/det-h-1.html). 


- take in an image of the night sky at a particular location and depending on where the objects are in the sky, calculate the location of the 
  observer where the picture was taken (not sure if possible).
