Project ideas:  
<X> - Simuate brownian motion of a larger particle amongst a bunch of small ones  
- create a fourier transform program, apply it to sounds first. 
- create an MRI image out of the raw data from this page (https://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/chap-10/detail/det-h-1.html). 


 take in an image of the night sky at a particular location and depending on where the objects are in the sky, calculate the location of the 
  observer where the picture was taken (not sure if possible).  

- make a more thorough and accurate solar prediction calculator than my previous python program. Use vectors more and simplify the overall math 
if possible.  

- See if its possible to do ray tracing around a blackhole, as a grand resumé type project

-Try simulating a tornado. 

-Try simulating water boiling in a container.  

-Try finding the ideal reentry angle when reentering the atmosphere from space so that it isnt too steep and takes on
too much heat but not too shallow or else it wont actual reenter the atmosphere.
